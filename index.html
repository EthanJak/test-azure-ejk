<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Itallian Trip's Itinerary</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Ethan Jakubowski. Last updated 12/4/21</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Original Plan</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">My original project was to make an interactive website that would serve as an itinerary for my trip to rome next semester. </p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">What I Delivered</h2>
<p>I created a website that showcased a couple of the locations I am going to be visiting next semester in Italy.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Features</h2>
<p>If I could continue working on this I would probably see if I could add more things around my tabs to make the site not seem as bland.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Contact Information</h2>
<p>If anyone wants to get in hold of me to disguss code things my email is ethangjakubowski@lewisu.edu
