<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Rome Trip's Itinerary</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Ethan Jakubowski. Last updated 11/17/21</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">My project will be an interactive website that will serve as an itinerary for my trip to rome next semester. </p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Technology Overview</h2>
<p>For this project I'll purly be working in html, since all that I'll be making is a website.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Basic Feature List</h2>
<p>I'd like it if I were ale to have some index on my webpage that would have tabs that would bring you to other pages on different
things that I'll be doing in Rome. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Advance Future Feature List</h2>
<p>If I had enough time it would be cool if I could somehow add links to the different street veiws of the locations I talk about so that the person looking at my itinerary 
can see the places I'm going to themselves.
